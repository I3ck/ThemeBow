# ThemeBow
Repo for ThemeBow.com themes and issue reporting

##adding a theme
- fork this repo  
- place your theme into the correct folder (depending on the editor it is meant for). `native/` is for ThemeBows own filetype
- submit a pull request and I'll happily add your theme
- if the editor type is not yet supported, please open an issue

##reporting an issue
Open an issue and I'll work on the problem

##missing editor support?  
Can't save the theme for your favorite editor? Or want to add a theme that is not supported yet? Feel free to open an issue.

##have an idea?
I'd love to hear about your ideas to improve ThemeBow.  
Just open an issue and I'll see what I can do.
